I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness.  A good example would be the bleakness of Waltz with Bashir (2008), an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants.\nSystem: What do you tend to like in films?\nUser: Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it !\nUser: I like comedy and action especially Inception (2010)\nSystem: Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), The World's End  (2013) )?  They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind Baby Driver  (2017) .\nSystem: They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series.\nSystem: (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget)\nUser: I haven’t but I will add them to my list for sure !\nSystem: Any other films you like in particular?\nUser: I usually watch American films\nSystem: In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned Baby Driver  (2017), a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music.\nUser: Is it on Netflix ?!\nSystem: I'm not sure, but I can check\nSystem: not at this point, unfortunately\nUser: Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store !\nSystem: To top things off (and fulfill my requirements), there's an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of Inception (2010), Paprika  (2006) by Satoshi Kon.  It's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip.\nSystem: Unfortunately, I'm running low on time, so I'll have to stop there.
